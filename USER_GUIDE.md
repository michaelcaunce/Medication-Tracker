### How Alerts Work

The system continuously monitors for due medications. When a medication becomes due:

1. **Full-screen alert appears** - Cannot be missed
2. **Audio tone plays** - Continuous beeping until resolved
3. **Voice announcement** - AI voice reads: "Attention. [Student Name]. [Medication Name] [Dosage]. Please administer now."
4. **Visual cues** - Pulsing animation and high-contrast colours

### Alert Layouts

- **1 alert** = Full screen
- **2 alerts** = Split screen (side-by-side)
- **4+ alerts** = Grid layout

### Alert Actions

Each alert tile has three action options:

#### 1. ‚úì Administered (Green Button)

## Testing with Time Simulator

The Time Simulator allows you to test the alert system without waiting for real time to pass.

### How to Use

1. Go to the Dashboard
2. Click **"‚è∞ Time Simulator"**
3. Enter the number of minutes to advance:
   - Positive number = Jump forward (e.g., 60 = 1 hour ahead)
   - Negative number = Go back (e.g., -30 = 30 minutes back)
4. Click **"OK"**
5. The system immediately checks for alerts based on the new simulated time

### Example Test Scenarios

**Test a single alert:**
```
Current time: 08:00
Enter: 30
Result: Time becomes 08:30 - Oliver Davies' medication alert appears
```

**Test multiple alerts:**
```
Current time: 08:00
Enter: 60
Result: Time becomes 09:00 - Three alerts appear (Emma, Sophie, Lily)
```

**Test overdue alert:**
```
Current time: 09:00
Enter: 20
Result: Time becomes 09:20 - Alerts show "OVERDUE by 20 minutes"
```

**Reset time:**
```
Enter: 0
Result: Returns to real current time
```

### Pre-configured Test Times

The seed data includes medications at these times:
- **08:00** - 1 medication
- **08:30** - 1 medication
- **09:00** - 3 medications (great for testing multiple alerts)
- **12:00** - 2 medications
- **15:00** - 1 medication
- **18:00** - 1 medication
